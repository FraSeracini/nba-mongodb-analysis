# NBA MongoDB Analysis

This project explores 30 years of NBA regular season data using MongoDB. It was developed for the **Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data (SMBUD)** course at Politecnico di Milano (AY 2024–2025) by Francesco Seracini and Federico Valsecchi.

## 📄 Project Description

Using a dataset of over 31,000 NBA games (1985–2014), we implemented a MongoDB-based pipeline to extract insights about:

- Team performance and historical trends
- Player statistics and efficiency
- Game outcomes and their relation to key metrics
- The evolution of the three-point shot over time

MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling semi-structured, document-oriented data.  The selected dataset is an extensive collection of NBA data, primarily compiled by Va
leri Karpov, a software engineer who scraped data from "Basketball-Reference.com" and converted it into a MongoDB-friendly format

## 🧠 Key Analyses

- 🔢 Win percentage, point scoring, and home/away performance by team

- 🧍‍♂️ Best scorers, most assists, and triple-double leaders  
- 🕰️ Evolution of scoring and 3-point attempts from 1985 to 2014  
- 📊 Visualizations created with Python and MongoDB queries
